= SPDX link inline macro
:toc:

It's an inline macro for easily creating licenses from SPDX license data.


== Synopsis

[source, asciidoc]
----
spdx:$LICENSE_ID[$CAPTION]
----

Where...

* `$LICENSE_ID` is the identifier for the license.

* `$CAPTION` is the link caption to be used.
By default, it will use the name of the license.


== Example usage

* `spdx:MIT[]` will result to the link:https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html[MIT license page on SPDX] with the caption `MIT License`.

* `spdx:MIT[the MIT license]` is the same as the previous example but with a different caption of `the MIT license`.
